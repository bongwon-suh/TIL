# Initialize Weights

- Not all 0's

- Challenging issue

- RBM

  - Apply the RBM idea on adjacent two layers as a pre-training step
  - Continue the first process to all layers
  - This will set weights
  - Example : Deep Belief Network

- Xavier initialization / He's initialization

  - Makes sure the weights are 'just right', not too small, not too big
  - Using number of input (fan_in) and output (fan_out)
